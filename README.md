Week 7 – Module 4
This week’s assignment has two programs based on using if-statements and fixing logical errors.
module4_part1.cpp - This program creates a small menu where the user can choose an option. I used basic if/else statements to check their choice and print the right message.
module4_part2.cpp - This program asks the user for three numbers and uses nested if-statements to figure out which number is the largest.
