# CIS25 | Week 6: 
I already had VS Code installed, but it took longer than I'd like to admit to get all I needed for C++ installed. MSYS2 still gives me random errors when VS Code tries to find it, so I’m still figuring that out. All of week 6 homework should be in the file sharing its name. Please let me know if I should separate them into different files. The file includes: Array practice: lets me enter numbers into an array and prints them back, Pointer demo: shows pointer behavior by printing addresses and values, Binary search: lets me type a number and tells me the index if it’s found. Happy Holidays!
